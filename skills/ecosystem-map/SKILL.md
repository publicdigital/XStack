description: Map the ecosystem around a service – every actor, channel, system, and relationship, not just the digital ones – so the team can see who and what the service actually depends on. Canonical output is Markdown; optionally renders a single-file HTML visual in the GovBB style. Use in discovery.

# Ecosystem map

This skill maps the ecosystem a service lives in: the actors (citizens, intermediaries, MDA staff, other agencies, private players), the channels they use, the systems they touch, and the relationships between them. Where the journey map is a sequence, the ecosystem map is a network.

It supports Barbados Digital Service Standard 1 (meet user needs), Standard 2 (multidisciplinary team – it shows who needs to be in the room), and Standard 7 (open, interoperable platforms), and GOV.UK Principle 7 (understand context).

## When to use this skill

- **Discovery, weeks 2–4** – once stakeholder interviews and early research start revealing who's actually involved
- When a service keeps failing at an organisational boundary and nobody can see why
- Before integration decisions – the map shows which systems exist and who owns them

The stakeholder map in `xstack:discovery-kit` lists who has skin in the game; the ecosystem map shows how they're connected in practice. For the sequence a citizen moves through, defer to `xstack:journey-map`; for the machinery under one service, `xstack:service-blueprint`.

## The template

```markdown
# Ecosystem map – [service / need]

**Centre of the map:** [the citizen need, verb-led – not the MDA]
**Evidence base:** [stakeholder interviews, research sessions, system inventory]
**Date / team:**

## Actors

| Actor | Type | Role in the ecosystem | Relationship to the need | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| e.g. Medical Council registrar | Government | Approves renewals | Gatekeeper | [interview 4] |
| e.g. Doctor's practice manager | Intermediary | Does the renewal on the doctor's behalf | Hidden primary user | [P2, P5] |

## Channels

| Channel | Owned by | Used for | Volume / notes |
|---|---|---|---|

## Systems and registers

| System | Owner | Holds | Integrates with | Standard 7 notes (reusable? blocked?) |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Relationships and flows

[Each significant relationship as: Actor A → (what flows: money, documents, data, trust, chasing) → Actor B. Flag the flows that are informal – the phone call, the WhatsApp group, the person who walks the file over.]

## Boundaries and gaps

[Where responsibility passes between organisations and things fall through. Where no actor owns a step citizens need. These are usually the findings.]
```

## Rules

1. **Put the citizen need at the centre, not the MDA.** An ecosystem map organised around the department reproduces the org chart. Organised around the need, it reveals intermediaries and informal actors the org chart doesn't know about.
2. **Hunt for the informal actors.** The cousin who fills in forms, the fixer outside the office, the Facebook group where everyone actually learns the process. Research transcripts (via `xstack:transcript-analysis`) are the best source – citizens name these people when asked what they actually did.
3. **Map what flows, not just who exists.** A list of actors is a phonebook. The value is in the flows – especially the chasing, the re-submissions, and the informal data flows that carry personal information outside any system (flag those for the cyber engineer – Standard 11).
4. **Every system gets a Standard 7 note.** Reusable platform? Owned register? Dead-end spreadsheet? This map is where the reuse conversation starts.
5. **Evidence or `[ASSUMPTION]`**, same as every xstack map.

## Optional: single-file HTML visual

Render as one self-contained HTML file (`ecosystem-map.html`) in the xstack prototype pattern: single file, Figtree via Google Fonts, inline CSS approximating the GovBB design system (`govbb-` prefix, navy `#00267F`, no Tailwind, no invented colours). Place the citizen need at the centre, actors grouped in rings or clusters by type (citizen-side, intermediaries, government, systems), and draw the flows as labelled connections – informal flows visibly distinct (e.g. dashed). The Markdown is canonical; regenerate the HTML from it.

## What makes a good ecosystem map

- At least one actor or flow the MDA didn't know existed
- The informal economy around the service is on the map, not politely omitted
- Every boundary where citizens fall through is named
- The Standard 7 column gives the developer a real starting list for integration conversations
