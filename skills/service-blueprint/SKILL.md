description: Produce a service blueprint – the journey plus everything underneath it – frontstage staff actions, backstage processes, supporting systems, and policies, separated by the lines of interaction, visibility, and internal interaction. Canonical output is Markdown; optionally renders a single-file HTML visual in the GovBB style. Use from alpha onwards when the team needs to make the back office visible.

# Service blueprint

This skill produces a service blueprint: a journey map with the machinery underneath made visible. Where the journey map shows what the citizen experiences, the blueprint shows what the organisation does – and fails to do – to produce that experience.

It supports Barbados Digital Service Standard 1 (meet user needs), Standard 5 (works first time), and Standard 7 (open, interoperable platforms), and GOV.UK Principle 7 (understand context) and Principle 8 (build digital services, not websites).

Most service failures citizens experience are backstage failures – the paper file that moves between buildings, the approval that waits for one officer, the system that doesn't talk to the other system. A blueprint is how the team finds them before citizens do.

## When to use this skill

- **Alpha onwards** – once a future-state journey exists and the team needs to know what has to be true operationally to deliver it
- **Current state** – when a discovery has found that the pain is backstage (long waits, lost files, repeat visits) and the team needs to see why
- **Before `xstack:build-for-production`** – the blueprint names the integrations and operational dependencies the production build must handle

Build the blueprint **on top of** a journey map from `xstack:journey-map` – the citizen row of the blueprint should match it. For actors and systems as a network rather than a sequence, defer to `xstack:ecosystem-map`.

## The structure

A blueprint is the journey's steps as columns, with swimlane rows separated by three lines:

- **Line of interaction** – between what the citizen does and what frontstage staff/interfaces do
- **Line of visibility** – between what the citizen can see and what happens backstage
- **Line of internal interaction** – between backstage people/processes and the supporting systems and policies

```markdown
# Service blueprint – [service name]

**State:** Current / Future
**Journey map this sits under:** [link]
**Evidence base:** [front-line shadows, MDA interviews, system documentation, transcripts]
**Date / team:**

| | Step 1: [name] | Step 2: [name] | … |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Citizen actions** | (mirrors the journey map) | | |
| **Frontstage – people & interfaces** | The clerk, the counter, the screen, the letter | | |
| — *line of visibility* — | | | |
| **Backstage actions** | What staff do that the citizen never sees – checks, approvals, re-keying | | |
| **Supporting systems** | Named systems, registers, spreadsheets, the fax machine. Flag what doesn't integrate – Standard 7 | | |
| **Policies & rules** | The law, the fee schedule, the "we've always done it this way" | | |
| **Time** | How long this step takes, and how long the citizen waits | | |
| **Failure points** | Where it breaks, with evidence | | |
| **Evidence** | [shadow], [MDA interview], [system doc], [ASSUMPTION] | | |
```

## Rules

1. **Backstage claims need backstage evidence.** A blueprint built only from citizen interviews is a journey map with guesses under it. Shadow the front line, interview the officers, read the system documentation – and mark anything unverified as `[ASSUMPTION]`.
2. **Name the systems.** Not "the database" – the actual register, the actual spreadsheet, who owns it, and whether it can integrate. This is where Standard 7 reuse opportunities and blockers surface.
3. **Time is the most honest row.** "Processing" that takes 4 weeks because a file sits in a tray is the finding. Record elapsed time and touch time separately where you can.
4. **Follow the failure demand.** Where do citizens call, revisit, or complain because a backstage step failed silently? Those failure points are the blueprint's most valuable output.
5. **Future-state blueprints name owners.** Every backstage change the future state requires gets a named owner and a "what has to be true" note – otherwise the prototype is writing cheques the back office can't cash.

## Optional: single-file HTML visual

For workshops and MDA walkthroughs, render the blueprint as one self-contained HTML file (`service-blueprint.html`) in the xstack prototype pattern: single file, Figtree via Google Fonts, inline CSS approximating the GovBB design system (`govbb-` prefix, navy `#00267F`, design-system tokens – no Tailwind, no invented colours). Draw the three lines as full-width horizontal rules labelled *line of interaction*, *line of visibility*, *line of internal interaction*, with the swimlanes between them and failure points visually flagged. The Markdown is canonical; regenerate the HTML from it.

## What makes a good blueprint

- The MDA's operational staff recognise it – and correct it, which is the point of showing them
- At least one "we had no idea it did that" moment for the delivery team
- Every failure point traceable to evidence, every future-state change traceable to an owner
- It makes the case for (or against) integration work with named systems, not vibes
