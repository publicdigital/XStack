# Renew Medical Licence – production build

> **Barbados profile example.** This example uses the Barbados country profile (`profiles/barbados/`), so it cites the Barbados standards and uses Barbados platforms and styling. See `examples/README.md`.

Production-ready front-end for the medical-licence renewal service, generated from `examples/build-renew-medical-licence/prototype-1-phone-first/iteration-3/index.html` via `/xstack:productionise`. Includes a comprehensive test suite – regression, accessibility, security, and load.

> This is the **front-end's contribution** to alpha-to-beta readiness. The backend, threat model, pen test, runbook, and operational readiness sit in parallel workstreams owned by the developer, the cyber engineer, and the delivery manager.

## Quick start

```bash
# Install Playwright + axe-core
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Install k6 (one of:)
brew install k6                                    # macOS
sudo apt-get install k6                            # Ubuntu / Debian
# or use the Docker image: docker pull grafana/k6

# Serve and audit
npm run serve         # http://localhost:8080, with the security headers set
npm run audit         # static checks, no browser, no network

# Run the test categories
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:a11y
npm run test:security
npm run test:load:peak
npm run test:load:soak

# Everything
npm run test:all
```

## What's different from the alpha prototype

| Alpha prototype | Production build |
|---|---|
| `prototype-1-phone-first/iteration-3/index.html` – one file with all 9 pages | 9 separate HTML files, one per URL |
| Inline `<style>` block ~250 lines | Linked stylesheet at `assets/govbb.css` |
| `<button onclick="goTo('page-X')">` | `<a href="X.html">` or `<form action="X.html">` |
| JavaScript-driven navigation | Server-side navigation; JS as progressive enhancement only |
| `<aside id="assumptions">` listing 16 unverified items | **Removed** – production users never see this |
| `<div class="xstack-banner">` | **Removed** |
| `<span class="fake-data">Dr. Sarah K. Williams</span>` | Plain `Dr. Sarah K. Williams` with HTML comments noting where templating would inject real values |
| No tests | 3 E2E specs, axe-core suite, security headers tests, 2 k6 load profiles, static audit |
| No build tooling | npm + Playwright + axe-core + k6 |

## What's not in this build (by design)

- No backend – Trident ID, the payment gateway, the Council register are mocked at the HTML level. The developer agent's job to wire them up.
- No CI config – the team picks GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar. `scripts/run-all.sh` is the entry point.
- No deployment – hosting and infra is operational readiness.
- No bespoke chrome – the GovBB design system is the source of truth.
- No analytics yet – wire in once the back end is in place, with the cyber engineer's data-minimisation guidance.

See `PRODUCTION-READINESS.md` for the full Standards-anchored assessment and the recommended next steps.

## How the tests are organised

**E2E regression (Playwright)** – three specs covering the most common citizen journey, the most-different alternative path, and the error states. Tests use accessible selectors (role + name) so failures double as accessibility regressions.

**Accessibility (axe-core)** – one suite running WCAG 2.1 AA across every page in its default state, plus interactive states (each radio option, expanded disclosures). Anything below AA fails the build. Standard 3 floor.

**Security (Playwright + bash)** – header policy enforced: CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy. CSP forbids `unsafe-inline`. The bash script is for CI environments without a browser. Standard 11 front-end contribution.

**Load (k6)** – two profiles. Peak ramps to twice the expected Oct–Dec volume (Sandra Layne's account: ~70% of annual ~1,000 renewals concentrate Oct–Dec). Soak is 8 hours of moderate load to surface memory leaks, connection-pool exhaustion, response-time drift. Run against staging, never against production. Standard 5 and Standard 13.

## Where this fits in xstack

```
brief → /xstack:discover → /xstack:build → /xstack:iterate (× N) → /xstack:productionise → /xstack:assess for beta gate → private beta → public beta → live
                                                  ↑                  ↑
                                               you are here     production folder       (this report feeds the assessment)
```

After this skill, the team:

1. Wires the suite into CI
2. Runs the full Playwright matrix against staging
3. Refreshes the threat model with `/xstack:threat-model`
4. Runs the k6 peak test against staging
5. Schedules the pen test
6. Runs `/xstack:assess for the beta gate` with the delivery manager – this report is the front-end evidence
