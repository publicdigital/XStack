# Consolidated assumptions – Renew medical licence build

Every assumption across the three prototypes, in one place. Each tagged with how it will be validated. Each linked to the prototype(s) it appears in and the Standards it affects.

| Tag | Meaning | Default validation method |
|---|---|---|
| `[VERIFY WITH USERS]` | Needs a citizen (doctor) to confirm | User testing sessions |
| `[VERIFY WITH MDA]` | Needs an MDA conversation to confirm | Direct briefing with Medical Council / MoHW |
| `[VERIFY WITH MIST]` | Needs the platform team to confirm | Direct briefing with MIST |
| `[VERIFY WITH POLICY]` | Needs a legal or regulatory check | Brief with Council legal / DPO |
| `[VERIFY WITH DATA]` | Needs analytics or operational data | Existing-data review |
| `[KNOWN GAP]` | The team knows this isn't right yet | Backlog for next iteration |

## Cross-cutting themes

Three patterns the team should pull out of testing regardless of which prototype is chosen.

### Trust calibration
How much friction does the citizen want for a regulatory action? Prototype 2's single-tap may feel too light; Prototype 1's seven-page flow may feel too heavy. Truth is probably between them, and varies by category of doctor. (Standard 11, Standard 5)

### Institutional bias
Prototypes 2 and 3 both lean on institutions (hospital HR, Council bookable officers). This works for the median doctor but excludes the edges – locums, private practice, overseas-trained doctors mid-rotation. Standard 3 is most at risk here.

### CPD as the binding constraint
Every prototype hits the CPD evidence question and handles it differently. This is the single most variable part of doctors' lives – the renewal redesign may be a CPD-evidence redesign in disguise. (Standard 5, Standard 7)

## What's not in these prototypes (but should be in iterations)

Honest list of what we deliberately left out.

- Error states (validation failures, payment failures, expired session)
- The Trident ID "Something's wrong" remediation flow
- Renewal-from-abroad (overseas-trained doctors on rotation)
- Renewal-after-lapse (where the licence has already expired)
- Renewal-with-conditions (where the Council has placed a condition on the licence)
- Disciplinary state handling
- Multilingual support beyond English
- Screen-reader walkthrough (the prototypes are AA-ready in structure but not audited yet)
- Real session-state for "save and come back later"

Each of these should appear in the iteration backlog and be addressed by round 3 at the latest.

## How to validate efficiently

A practical recipe:

1. **Week 1:** test all three prototypes back-to-back with 4–6 doctors. Don't ask them to pick a winner. Ask what they did, what stopped them, what they wished was different.
2. **Week 2:** brief Trident ID team (MIST), the Medical Council, and Data Protection on the items that need them. Many of these can be parallel.
3. **Week 3:** existing-data review with the Council on volumes, peaks, current journey times, and the cohort split (public vs private practice).
4. **Week 4:** policy items – brief with the Council's legal counsel.
5. **Continuous:** `/xstack:iterate` after each round.

By the end of week 4, most assumptions should have moved to either confirmed-with-evidence or resolved-by-changing-the-design.
